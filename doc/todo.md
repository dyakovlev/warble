# TODO

## backend

- roll a basic server package (serves webapp, provides rudimentary backend)
- deploy to remote host reliably

## frontend

- get es6 to build (JSPM probably still)
- build out UI JS (dep frontend template system)
- build prototype of draggable (or adapt oss)

## research

- find a frontend templating system that works client-side (for dynamic UI building)
- revise event system to broaden gap between events and function call chains

## administrative

- new name (warble is sort of taken maybe..)
- graphic design (visual treatment of whole application, UX design)
- hosting
